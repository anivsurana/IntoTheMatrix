This project is based on the prompt provided in the Final Assignment
in COM4503 at the University of Sheffield, with Dr. Steve Maddock. This
project has been slightly adapted with newly added code by Aniv Surana (University of Texas at Arlington)

This project is the submission for the contract with Dr. Alex Dillhoff for the course CSE 3380.

How to run the code:
    Navigate to the main code directory and run the following command:
    javac Museum.java && java Museum



How to use the program:
    You can switch the inside light, the outside light and the spotlight by pressing the corresponding toggle buttons.
    You can move the robot to the 1-5 positions by pressing the buttons labelled "Position X"
    The robot will then animate and move to the specivied position, adjust it's body angle, adjust it's head tilt,
    change the eye direction, change the hair angle, change the lips size, and move its eyebrow.


Textures:
    some of the textures are downloaded from https://www.textures.com/, and the rest has been drawn by hand.


Video demonstration:
    A video demonstration of the program can be found at https://youtu.be/6jJt6fb7KJk
    The video showcases the features in the following order:
    1. switching the lights off and on (the specular map on the egg can also be seen there and the fact that the reflections dissear as expected)
    2. various robot poses (spotlight appearing on the robot's texture in pose 3)
    4. day / night cycle of the outside view
    5. poses close-up
    6. specular map reflections moving with the camera
